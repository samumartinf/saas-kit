## 5. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### 5.1 Recommended Scraping Approach

```
Priority Order:
1. APIs (GtR, OAI-PMH) - Structured, reliable
2. Profile directories - Consistent format
3. Department pages - Variable structure
4. Individual lab websites - Most variable
```

### 5.2 OAI-PMH Harvesting

**UCL Discovery:**
```bash
# List available sets
curl "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/cgi/oai2?verb=ListSets"

# Harvest metadata
curl "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/cgi/oai2?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc"
```

**Spiral (Imperial):**
```bash
curl "https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/dspace-oai/request?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc"
```

### 5.3 GtR API Example

```bash
# Search projects by organisation
curl "https://gtr.ukri.org/gtr/api/projects?org=University%20College%20London"

# Get project details
curl "https://gtr.ukri.org/gtr/api/projects/{project_id}"
```

## 7. NEXT STEPS

1. **Start with APIs** - GtR and OAI-PMH provide the cleanest structured data
2. **Profile directories** - UCL Profiles and Imperial Profiles have consistent formats
3. **Build department scrapers** - Each department has similar structure within university
4. **Cross-reference** - Match researchers across funding, publications, and patents
5. **NLP processing** - Apply summarization and classification to abstracts
